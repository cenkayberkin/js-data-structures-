#Binary tree traversal
- There are 3 types of depth first traversals, and one type of breadth first traversal
- i have implemented depth first traversal using recursive algorithm and breadth first traversals using a queue and non recursive algorithm.

===================

#Double linkedlist implemented.
##Features
- insert(node) will insert the given node at the head of the list.
- size() will return the length of the list.
- search(val) will return the node containing 'val' in the list, if present, else nil.
- remove(node) will remove the given node from the list, wherever it might be. Return the node's value. If it isn't found, return nil.
- to_s() will print a comma-separated list of all values in the list, whatever they might be: "12, 'sam', :item, 'tango', 42"
